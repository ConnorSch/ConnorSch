- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Connor Schleicher (@ConnorSch)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things data and math.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge of different python libraries along with playing with different optimization algorithms. I'm working on understanding
why certain algorithms will converge faster than other for specific problems. 
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me by email (connors2015@gmail.com) or on here.
